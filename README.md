# Horiseon: Refactor code

Hello World! 
My name is Sheldon Stevens and I was given the task to refactor pre-built code
and insure that it meets the customers specific set of Criteria.

## Usage

```
An informational, html based site, for Horiseon that follows accessibility standards
and is optimized for a variety of search engines.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
-- [x] A webpage meets accessibility standards
---- [x] WHEN I view the source code 
         THEN I find semantic HTML elements
-- [x] WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
       THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
---- [x] WHEN I view the image elements
         THEN I find accessible alt attributes
-- [x] WHEN I view the heading attributes
       THEN they fall in sequential order
---- [x] WHEN I view the title element
         THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
